# 📊 BlueCart Marketing Campaign Project  
### 🎯 Driving Smarter Ad Spend for Online Retail Success

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is a digital marketing case study for **BlueCart**, a fast-growing online retail brand. The aim was to analyze past advertising campaign performance and help the team make **data-driven decisions** to optimize ad spend, improve campaign effectiveness, and maximize **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**.

Using **Power BI**, I built a dynamic dashboard that uncovered which platforms, campaigns, and durations performed best — ultimately providing actionable insights and strategic recommendations.

## ✅ Key Outcomes

- Identified **YouTube** and **Twitter** as top-performing platforms in terms of **ROAS, revenue, and conversion rate**
- Flagged **Google Ads** as the least efficient platform based on high CPC and low ROAS
- Revealed that **shorter campaigns (1–3 weeks)** consistently outperformed longer ones
- Provided clear recommendations to **reallocate budget** and focus on high-conversion regions
